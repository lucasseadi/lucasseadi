Hi, I’m @lucasseadi

I’m interested in web development (mostly back-end) in Javascript and Php, and I’m currently learning Python and AI engineering.

You can reach me through LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-seadi/) or Gmail (lucasseadi@gmail.com).

In the meantime, I'll really try to put more projects here or other things I'll be working on.

See ya!
